## Improvements:
 - Can be done in Multi Module
 - Add more Unit/UI Tests
 - Build UI with Compose
 - Add more error handling 
 - Incorporate UseCases/Mapper but it will be too much for a simple app
 -

2. Build your project (Build -> Rebuild Project).
3. Run your app (Run -> Run 'app').

## Unit Tests
1. Android Studio:
